## My Machine Learning Workspace

This is my workspace for Machine Learning. 
Each directory is an independent work which stands on its own, and the README files in them describe the work/ project.

### Projects:

* **[linear-regression-gradient-descent](./linear-regression-gradient-descent)**
  * Linear regression using Gradient Descent algorithm on Mean Squared Error.
* **[shake-detection-classifier](./shake-detection-classifier)**
  * Building a classifier for detecting _shake_ gestures using data from phone sensors.
* **[titanic-survival-modeling](./titanic-survival-modeling)**
  * Predicting survival on the Titanic (using dataset from Kaggle).

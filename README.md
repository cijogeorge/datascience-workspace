## My Workspace for Machine Learning

This is my workspace for Machine Learning. 
Each directory is an independent work which stands on its own, and the README files in them describe the work/ project.

### Projects: 

* **shake-detection**
  * Building a classifier for detecting _shake_ gestures using data from phone sensors.
* **titanic**
  * Predicting survival on the Titanic (using dataset from Kaggle).

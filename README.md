## My Workspace for Machine Learning

This is my workspace for Machine Learning. 
Each directory is an independent work which stands on its own, and the README files in them describe the work/ project.

### Projects: 

* **shake-detection:** Building a classifier for detecting Shake gestures using data from phone sensors
* **titanic:** Solution to one of the 'getting started' machine learning problems in Kaggle on Predicting survival on the Titanic. Click here for the Kaggle page on this problem.

## Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

In [this](./gradient_descent.ipynb) notebook, I've built a simple linear regression model using gradient descent to fit a line (y = mx + c) through input data consisting of (x, y) values. The purpose is to better understand gradient descent by calculating the gradients by hand and implementing it without using out-of-the-box libraries/ methods.
